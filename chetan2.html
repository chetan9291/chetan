 <h2>Paragraph 1</h2>
 <p>Again, we don’t recommend using Google Drive as your main hosting service, but if you’re using Google Drive anyway for saving and sharing your files, this added functionality can’t hurt. Because the company requires that you first share your files publicly, there shouldn’t be any privacy concerns here – nobody is going to see your website before it’s finished unless you explicitly give them the link</p>
 <h2>Paragraph 2</h2>
 <P>Google’s goal here is of course to get more and more people using Google Drive over competing services. If your current cloud storage service can’t do this, we doubt you’ll switch, but if you’re already using Google Drive, you may find yourself using it more than Dropbox or SkyDrive.</P>

 <P>Google LLC[5] is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An Initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google, Alphabet's leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.</P>

 <P>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.[8]

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[9] They called this new technology PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site</P>
